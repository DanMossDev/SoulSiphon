# Soul Siphon

## Somewhere between a Metroidvania and a Roguelite where you can steal your enemy's magic
Soul Siphon is a little idea I've been cooking up for a while. The loose idea is that you are a magic user who is able to siphon people's souls to "steal" their magic, and that as you progress through the levels you would be given the chance to steal different boss's magic.

My current long term goal for this game is to implement:

- 3 Levels (Cave, Heaven, The Void)
- 4 Elemental movesets (Wind, Fire, Holy, Void)
- Roguelite elements; perhaps once you unlock an element you can choose to start with it, randomised floors is something I would look to implement

Down the line I would quite like to get some custom art commissioned, but currently I am using the following packs:
