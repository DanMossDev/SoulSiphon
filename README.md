# Tile Based Metroidvania Template

## A little template with some fun custom movement mechanics
My starting point for a Metroidvania, in its current state it has movement mechanics (including some QoL features like coyote time, buffered jumps etc.), a shooting mechanic which the player can hold to charge to shoot further, and a black hole spawning mechanic which will travel out towards the mouse while held, then on release will pull all nearby enemies and the player if they are close enough towards it.

I'm a programmer not an artist, any assets I use will be linked to below.
